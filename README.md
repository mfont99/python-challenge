Module 3 challenge assignment


Almost all the code for these two scripts was my own. 

The only assistance I received was from the AI (Xpert Learning Assistant):

  AI provided the syntax for how to round a value to a certain number of decimal places.
  AI gave me the suggestion/idea of using a dictionary and key-value pairs when dynamically storing information about candidates and their corresponding vote counts.
  AI helped with the debugging process of getting the dictionary syntax to work correctly inside a loop (lines 24 through 30 in the script).
  Lastly, AI gave me the much needed ".items()" suffix on line 42. This allowed me to loop through the keys AND values of the dictionary using two variables rather than just the keys with one variable.
